Partials can be constructed by invoking a constructor Partial(DateTimeFieldType[], int[]) or by merging together a set of partials using with, each constructed by calling Partial(DateTimeFieldType, int), e.g.:
Partial a = new Partial(new DateTimeFieldType[] { year(), hourOfDay() }, new int[] { 1, 1});
Partial b = new Partial(year(), 1).with(hourOfDay(), 1);
assert(a == b);
However, the above doesn't work in all cases:
new Partial(new DateTimeFieldType[] { clockhourOfDay(), hourOfDay() }, new int[] { 1, 1}); // throws Types array must not contain duplicate
new Partial(clockhourOfDay(), 1).with(hourOfDay(), 1); // #<Partial [clockhourOfDay=1, hourOfDay=1]>
I suppose the Partials should not allow to be constructed in either case. Is that right?
There's also a related issue (probably stems from the fact that the Partial is invalid):
new Partial(clockhourOfDay(), 1).with(hourOfDay(), 1).isEqual(new Partial(hourOfDay() ,1).with(clockhourOfDay(), 1)) // throws objects must have matching field types



Yes, it looks like the with method is missing some validation.
