I would like to cut Gson 2.6.2 with this change. Let me know if you have any concerns @swankjesse and @JakeWharton



Fix looks reasonable but the test case looks like you just pulled it from another codebase. Could you write a targeted test case instead?



Done, take another look.



I still donâ€™t really understand this test. Would end users use ThreadLocals ?



@swankjesse  This is production code written by me for a specific use-case.
I was interacting with a REST service that, unfortunately, stored JSON as s String in a field. To support that with JSON, I wrote this adapter class. I didn't start with ThreadLocals, but the recursive invocation from JsonAdapterFactory forced my hand.



Rather than starting with the test you used to trigger this in your application, can you build a test case from scratch specifically to reproduce this bug?



(I don't imagine that parsing JSON as a string is necessary for the fix made here.)



Erm, you shouldn't need to convert a string from JSON within another type adapter.



Ok, revised the test to eliminate string to JSON conversion.



Yeah, that's more obvious. Thanks!
