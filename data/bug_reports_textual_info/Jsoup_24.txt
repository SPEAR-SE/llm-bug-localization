Loses a single quote when the javascript contains a partial tag, exampled pared from ad section of http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula.  Note in the result that '</scr is missing closing ' :
Input:
<HTML>
<body>
 <div>
  <script language="JavaScript1.1"> 
    document.write('</scr' + 'ipt>');
  </script>
 </div>
</body>
</HTML>

Result:
<html>
 <body> 
  <div> 
   <script language="JavaScript1.1"> 
    document.write('</scr + 'ipt>');
  
   </script> 
  </div>  
 </body>
</html>




Actually just got the latest from git and it seems to be working for 1.6.1!  Easy..



Hi the problem is actually not fixed in 1.6.1 if the script tag contains an HTML comment.
Input:
<script>
  <!--
    document.write('</scr' + 'ipt>');
  // -->
</script>
Result:
<script>
  <!--
    document.write('</scr + 'ipt>');
  // -->
</script>
Maybe this issue need to be reopened?



Ok, reopened.  Interestingly the above doesn't happen in just a html comment, but only if also within a script tag.



Thanks! Exactly, pretty freakyâ€¦



Thanks for pointing this out and digging into the test case



NP, thanks for fixing it! ;)
