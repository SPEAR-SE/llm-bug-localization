This issue is a successor to #1101.
Models:
// ? extends causes the issue
class BigClass { Map<String, ? extends List<SmallClass>> inBig; }

class SmallClass { String inSmall; }
Json:
{
  "inBig": {
    "key": [
      { "inSmall": "hello" }
    ]
  }
}
Gson call:
SmallClass small = new Gson().fromJson(json, BigClass.class).inBig.get("inSmall").get(0);
This call will fail with a ClassCastException exception â€“
com.google.gson.internal.LinkedTreeMap cannot be cast to Entry. If we remove ? extends then everything works fine.



was this ever fixed/released? I still see the problem even on v2.8.5



Could you please test if this still occurs with the latest Gson version? I think #1146 should have fixed this. At least the originally provided sample code seems to work, except that the member name seems to be incorrect: fromJson(json, BigClass.class).inBig.get("inSmallkey").get(0)
If you still experience this please provide a small self contained example, and mention which Gson version you are using.
