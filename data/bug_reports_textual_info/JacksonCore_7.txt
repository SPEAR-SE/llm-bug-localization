Add a check so JsonGenerator.writeString() won't work if writeFieldName() expected.

Looks like calling writeString() (and perhaps other scalar write methods) results in writing invalid output, instead of throwing an exception. It should instead fail; in future we may want to consider allowing this as an alias, but at any rate it should not produce invalid output.
