Example:
    static class Bean {
        int x;
        int y;

        @JsonUnwrapped
        UnwrappedBean w;

        public Bean(@JsonProperty("x") int x, @JsonProperty("y") int y) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }

        public void setW(UnwrappedBean w) {
            this.w = w;
        }
    }

    static class UnwrappedBean {
        int a;
        int b;

        public UnwrappedBean(@JsonProperty("a") int a, @JsonProperty("b") int b) {
            this.a = a;
            this.b = b;
        }
    }
    {"x": 1, "a": 2, "y": 3, "b": 4}
x, y, and a are deserialized as expected. b is skipped entirely. I think I've found the root cause and the fix doesn't appear to break any tests; opening a PR for further review.



Thank you for reporting this -- not sure how I managed to miss it. Looking now, hoping to merge for 2.9.7.
