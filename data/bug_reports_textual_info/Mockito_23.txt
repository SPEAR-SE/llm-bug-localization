Hey
I found a strange problem, when i create a abstract class:
abstract class AbstractClass {
    abstract protected Long lol();
    abstract protected String wow();
    public String give() {
        wow();
        lol();
        return "give";
    }
}
and i have another class extends abstract Class:
public class ClassExtendsAbstractClass extends AbstractClass {
@Override
 protected Long lol() {
        return 2L;
    }
    @Override
    protected String wow() {
        return "WOW";
    }
}
and I have class:
public class A {
  private ClassExtendsAbstractClass classExtendsAbstractClass;
  public A(ClassExtendsAbstractClass classExtendsAbstractClass) {
    this.classExtendsAbstractClass = classExtendsAbstractClass;
  }
  public String doSomeThing(){
    return classExtendsAbstractClass.wow();
  }
}
and when i try mock method doSomeThing() from A class in test:
  @Mock
  private ClassExtendsAbstractClass classExtendsAbstractClass;
  private A a;

  @Before
  public void before(){
    Mockito.when(classExtendsAbstractClass.give()).thenReturn("aaa");
  }
  @Test
  public void test() {
    a = new A(classExtendsAbstractClass);
  }
I get the error:

org.mockito.exceptions.misusing.WrongTypeOfReturnValue:
String cannot be returned by lol()
lol() should return Long

This is strange behavior, because the method lol() should not be called, but when I delete one abstract method everything is good.



Have you tried updating to the latest beta? We changed the byte code provider so this might already be resolved.



I using 2.0.2- beta from maven repository: http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-all/2.0.2-beta



We are currentlz at beta 2.0.50. I also just ran your example and everything seems to be fine.



When i try use 2.0.50-beta from i have error:

java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/mockito/cglib/proxy/Callback
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.mockito.cglib.proxy.Callback




Seems like you have different mockito versions in your project. The current version does no longer depend on cglib. (did you recompile your test classes?)



I had dependency to powermock-api-mockito that created the problem . Now everything is working properly



Perfect, thanks for reporting this back.
