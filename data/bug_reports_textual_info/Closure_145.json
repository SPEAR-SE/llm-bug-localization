What do you see instead?</b>\nThe generated code produced is :\r\nvar a=0;do b:do{a++;break b}while(0);while(0);console.log(a); \r\n\r\nWhich works on all browsers except IE (Looks like IE doesn't like \r\nthe missing brackets just after the first do instruction).\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nI am using the version of Jun 16 (latest) on ubuntu 10\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\nStrangely, this bug doesn't happen when I use PRETTY_PRINT formatting option.",
