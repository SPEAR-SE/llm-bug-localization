At about line 136 Tokenizer.java, reader.consumeLetterSequence() is called. This is fine until it an entity such as &sup1; is encountered - just the letter part of the entity name will be read causing the Entities.isNamedEntity(nameRef) call at about line 140 to fail.
I have fixed this quickly locally by replacing reader.consumerLetterSequence() with a call to a new consumeLetterDigitSequence() in the CharacterReader.java - there may be a better way of doing this:
String consumeLetterDigitSequence() {
    String letters = consumeLetterSequence();
    String digits = consumeDigitSequence();
    return letters + digits;
}

The following is a sample  unit test:
@Test public void letterDigitEntities() {
    String html = "<p>&sup1;&sup2;&sup3;&frac14;&frac12;&frac34;</p>";
    Whitelist whitelist = Whitelist.none();
    whitelist
        .addTags("p");
    String html = Jsoup.clean(html, whitelist);
    assertEquals("<p>&sup1;&sup2;&sup3;&frac14;&frac12;&frac34;</p>", html);
}




Thanks for pointing this out, and the code examples!
