Returning Void.class from com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.HandleUnknowTypeIdTest.testDeserializationWithDeserializationProblemHandler().new DeserializationProblemHandler() {...}.handleUnknownTypeId(DeserializationContext, JavaType, String, TypeIdResolver, String) is causing a NPE in jackson 2.9. I'll provide a pull request illustrating the issue in a test.



Thank you for reporting this! I'll have a look.
