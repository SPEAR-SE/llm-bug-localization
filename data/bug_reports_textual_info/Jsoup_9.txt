Some html entities (such as sup1, sup2) are not unescaped correctly by Entities.unescape because they contain digits.
The problem is the pattern Entities.unescapePattern. I changed it to '&(#(x|X)?([0-9a-fA-F]+)|[0-9a-zA-Z]+);?', and it worked fine for me. But there might be side effects ...

Thanks for finding this.



Fixed support for HTML entities with numbers in name (e.g. &frac34, &sup1)
