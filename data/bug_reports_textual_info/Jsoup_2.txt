This HTML, parsed and immediately printed out, results in:
<html>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">
var inside = true;
</script>
this should be outside.
</body>
</html>
Results:
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">
var inside = true;
this should be outside.
</script>
</body>
</html>
Note how "this should be outside" ends up inside the <script> tag, instead of following it.  From what I can tell, this only happens to data-only tags.



Thanks for finding and reporting that. The issue is caused by the routine that greedily parses the data-content not cleaning up the stack.



Clean up the parse stack correctly when parsing data-nodes.
