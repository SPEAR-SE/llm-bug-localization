To reproduce:

Create/find a html document of a frameset.
Parse the html.
Create a Cleaner instance and call the clean method with the document from step 2.
NullPointerException

Cause:
In Cleaner.clean(Document) (https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jsoup/safety/Cleaner.java#L43) the copySafeNodes is called with the document.body(). However, this is null when handling a frameset document.
Expected:
An empty document or perhaps null returned. But not a nullpointerException.



[+1]
HTML5 does not officially support <frameset>, but it is still wildly used over the web. Jsoup seems to not handle those frameset. Document.normalize() also seems to break frameset html document.
As a quickfix, you can avoid launching clean on frameset using
if ( !dirtyRoot.getElementsByTag("frameset") ) {



Thanks for pointing this out!
