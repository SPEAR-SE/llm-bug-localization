When a self-closing script block is encountered it appears that the state transitions do not account for the closing tag, so the rest of the document is considered to be in the body of the script tag, and so is escaped.
The unit test HtmlParserTest.handlesKnownEmptyBlocks() will fail if a self-closing script tag is included in the String h.



Thanks for the report. That's a bit weird.



The problem is that the unexpected self-closing tag handler (which is out of spec) is not getting the Tokeniser out of the ScriptData state. I don't want to just force it back into the Data state, because that ignores other internal states. Probably the right thing to do is track the previous Tokeniser and TreeBuilder states in the emit() method, and transition to those on read().



On review, I think it's OK to force back to state=data. It's explicitly a self closing tag, and could only have got into that state via the data state.
