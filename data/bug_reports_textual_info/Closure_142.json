What do you see instead?</b>\nExpected output is on the left-hand side of the page (it is generated by the raw source). Google \r\nClosure's output is on the right-hand side of the page.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nI downloaded compiler-latest.zip today (Nov. 24, 2009, ~ 12:00 PM EST)\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\nThere is a variable called &quot;threshold&quot; which is used to generate an array of arrays in the attached \r\nHTML file. If it is a small number, IE seems to pass arrays into the sort method (sorting an array \r\nof arrays) by value like all other browsers do. But when threshold is large enough (on my \r\nmachine that happens around 250) IE starts passing the arrays in by value. Google Closure \r\ncompiler has changed my original source from making local copies to modifying the arguments \r\nbeing passed into the sort comparator ... but as a result of this IE behavior the Closure compiled \r\ncode breaks.",

            "content": "So after looking into this some more, I've learned that arrays are always passed by reference, but that only \r\nmeans you can change attributes and individual items in an array. So for example:\r\n\r\nvar a = [1, 2, 3, 4];\r\nvar f = function(x){x = null;};\r\nf(a);\r\n// the value of a will remain [1, 2, 3, 4]\r\n// but if instead:\r\nvar g = function(x){x[0] = null;};\r\ng(a);\r\n// the value of a is now [null, 2, 3, 4]\r\n\r\nIn the attached example, the Google Closure compiled version is akin to the function f above, which means \r\nthat the value of the arrays should *not* be changing. In IE, if the threshold is set high enough, however, they \r\ndo indeed change. So the original report may not be accurate, but this is a real issue.",
