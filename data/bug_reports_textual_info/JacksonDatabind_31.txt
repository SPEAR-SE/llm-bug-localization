HI
I got an issue reported in my jackson-antpathfilter project that the filtering is not working correctly when it is used together with Jackson's convert feature: Antibrumm/jackson-antpathfilter#2
During the investigation i found out that the cause is that the writeContext is created differently and I am wondering if this is the desired behavior or if that's a bug for you.
In this comment (Antibrumm/jackson-antpathfilter#2 (comment)) I print out what is found in the writeContext and I have created a TestCase to reproduce the error.
Please let me know what you think.



Ideally contexts would work identically, but implementations do differ. Convert uses TokenBuffer for storing intermediate values, and handling may differ due to implementation details.
So it sounds like a flaw in implementation.



Yes, I think I can reproduce this with 2.6.3.



Turns out TokenBuffers writeNumber() (and other scalar methods) were not properly indicating value is being written, and that resulted (not sure how) field name not getting updated.
I created a unit test to reproduce issue, fix it -- however, it's not the exactly same as what you have, so verification would be useful, in case there could be other uncovered (so far) issues.
But for now I assume this resolves your problem as well.



You are too fast for me :) i planned to provide you with a test. I will now try it against your snapshot.
Thanks a lot.



I did a quick test now and this fixes the issue. Thanks üëç
(I did not yet implement an assert test)
mapper.writeValueAsString(judgements);
    [{"id":1,"judgementNo":"1","judgementDate":1446124992511,"courthouse":{"name":"Courthouse 1"}},{"id":2,"judgementNo":"2","judgementDate":1446124992511,"courthouse":{"name":"Courthouse 2"}}]

mapper.convertValue(judgements, mapper.getTypeFactory().constructCollectionType(List.class, Object.class););
    [{id=1, judgementNo=1, judgementDate=1446124992511, courthouse={name=Courthouse 1}}, {id=2, judgementNo=2, judgementDate=1446124992511, courthouse={name=Courthouse 2}}]




Ok good. At least it's not something that's obviously not fixed by my change. :)
