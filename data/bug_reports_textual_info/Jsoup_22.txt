Hi,
I have noticed that the sibling methods (nextSibling, previousSibling, siblingElements) rely on an element (underlying node) having a parent. If the node does not have a parent it throws null pointer exception.
Would it be possible to modify the code so that it checks for parent nullness around Node.java:468?
In the event of nullness return null as in the javadoc?
Confirmed in 1.6.2



Thanks for pointing this out!



Very cool. Thanks for the quick response again. Awesome project.
