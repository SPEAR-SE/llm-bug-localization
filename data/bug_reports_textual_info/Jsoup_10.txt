Document doc = Jsoup.parse(new URL("http://www.oschina.net/bbs/thread/12975"), 5*1000);
Elements es = doc.select("a[href]");
for(Iterator it = es.iterator();it.hasNext();){
Element e = it.next();
System.out.println(e.absUrl("href"));
}
attr("abs:href")   ------  <a href="?p=1">1</a>
result: -------------------   http://www.oschina.net/bbs/thread/?p=1
I think it's a wrong result~.
The correct results should be "http://www.oschina.net/bbs/thread/12975?p=1"



Thanks. I'm not really sure the best way to fix this. Jsoup uses Java's URL parser, and it seems to be mishandling this case. The method used is http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/net/URL.html#URL(java.net.URL, java.lang.String)
Where URL is the origin URL, and the spec string is the contents of the href.
May need to provide a hack for this specific case, or reimplement the URL parser; not really keen on either.



Fixed absolute URL generation from relative URLs which are only query strings.
