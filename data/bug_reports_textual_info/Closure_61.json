Try the following code, in Simple mode\r\nMath.blah = function(test) { test.a = 5; };\r\nvar test = new Object();\r\nMath.blah(test); \r\n2. The output is\r\nMath.blah=function(a){a.a=5};var test={};\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nNote that Math.blah(test) was removed. It should not be. It issues a warning: JSC_USELESS_CODE: Suspicious code. This code lacks side-effects. Is there a bug? at line 4 character 9\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nTested on Google hosted Closure service.\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\nClosure seems to be protective about Math in particular, and doesn't like people messing around with her? So, when I try the following code:-\r\nvar n = {};\r\nn.blah = function(test) { test.a = 5; };\r\nvar test = new Object();\r\nn.blah(test);\r\n\r\nIt works. When I replace n by Math, then again, Closure kicks out blah. I need that poor fellow. Please talk some sense into it.",

            "content": "There is some code in NodeUtil's side-effect detection code that assumes all Math.xxx lack side-effects.  An easy work around in simple mode is the assign the result of the function (even if it undefined) to a global variable.  In advanced mode, goog.reflect.sinkValue can be used.    It would make more sense however to white-list known Math methods, rather than assume they are all side-effect free (or simply don't assume anything and rely on the externs ).",
