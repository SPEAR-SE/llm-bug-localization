I'm having a problem removing nodes from forms using jsoup v1.7.3. The following code works as expected:
Connection.Response response = Jsoup.connect("myURL").execute();

Document doc = response.parse();

//prints HTML including "input[name=alpha]"
System.out.println(doc.toString());

doc.select("input[name=alpha]").first().remove();

//prints HTML excluding "input[name=alpha]"
System.out.println(doc.toString());

FormElement form = (FormElement)doc.select("form").first();

//prints HTML excluding "input[name=alpha]"
System.out.println(form.toString());

However, the following code appears to highlight a bug:
List<Connection.KeyVal> data = form.formData();

//prints a list including "alpha"
System.out.println(data.toString());

I would expect "alpha" to have been removed from the form data, but it hasn't. Is this a bug? Or am I doing something wrong?

Thanks for the report, and for the fix!
