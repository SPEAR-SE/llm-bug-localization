This affects at least 2.6.4 to current versions. In TreeTraversingParser#getBinaryValue, a Base64Variant is accepted but ignored. The call to n.binaryValue(), when n is a TextNode, then uses the default Base64 variant instead of what's specified. It seems the correct behavior would be to call TextNode#getBinaryValue instead.



Sounds like a flaw indeed. Just need to see how/where to access base64 variant.



If you change the assignment of byte[] data to:
            byte[] data = n.isTextual()
                    ? ((TextNode) n).getBinaryValue(b64variant)
                    : n.binaryValue();
That seems sufficient, though I am operating on 2.6 and it looks like ObjectMapper has undergone a lot of refactoring since then. Presumably it would propagate the variant down correctly to the method.
