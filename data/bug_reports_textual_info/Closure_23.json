Compile the following program with simple or advanced optimization:\r\nconsole.log([console.log('hello, '), 'world!'][1]);\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nThe expected output would preserve side effects. It would not transform the program at all or transform it into:\r\n\r\nconsole.log((console.log(&quot;hello&quot;), &quot;world!&quot;));\r\n\r\nInstead, the program is transformed into:\r\n\r\nconsole.log(&quot;world!&quot;);\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using?
