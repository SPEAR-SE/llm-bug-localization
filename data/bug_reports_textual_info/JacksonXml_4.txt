In jackson-dataformat-xml/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/dataformat/xml/ser/XmlSerializerProvider.java
Line 203, I think _rootNameFromConfig() should be used if available instead of ROOT_NAME_FOR_NULL, so that withRootName() config can be used.
I don't know whether/how deser would be affected

 _initWithRootName((ToXmlGenerator) jgen, ROOT_NAME_FOR_NULL); 








I'd need to understand more what the problem here is: what is not working, and how to reproduce the issue. Is this just the question of serialization of root-level null not using wrapping as expected?



Ok, I think I am able to reproduce what is being seen.
