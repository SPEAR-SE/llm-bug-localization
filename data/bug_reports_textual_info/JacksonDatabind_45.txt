Looks pretty good, but would it be possible to have a unit test that would fail before fix, pass after? Would be great to have something to guard against regression.
I may want to change the logic a little bit, however; if shape is explicitly defined as NUMBER, textual representation should not be enabled even if Locale (etc) happen to be specified: explicit shape value should have precedence. I can make that change, or you can do it, either way is fine.
I'll also need to merge this again 2.7 branch instead of master, to get in 2.7.3.



I'll add a test.
Regarding the "NUMBER" shape, from what I see it's already handled just a few lines above.



Here you go. I took the opportunity to rebase in order to:

make the test case appear first (so you can easily test before/after the fix)
squash my two fix commits




Excellent! I'll be happy to merge this fix then.
One practical thing before merging your first contribution: we need filled Contributor License Agreement (CLA), from:
https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/blob/master/contributor-agreement.pdf
It is the only piece of process we require, and once that one-pager is received nothing more is needed for any contributions to Jackson projects.
The simplest way usually is to print it, fill & sign, scan and email to info at fasterxml dot com.
Thank you once again, looking forward to merging this & including in 2.7.3 patch (which should get out within about week).



Done: I just sent the CLA.



Thank you again for the contribution! This will be included in 2.7.3.
