X5455_ExtendedTimestampTest is failing under JDK 9 , due to what appears to be a bogus value returned from getTime().  It seems like the test failure might be due to the changes introduced for this: 
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8073497
Tests were run using intelliJ TestRunner, using the openjdk9 build from the tip of the jdk9 tree (not dev).  I believe that this is at most one commit away from what will be the RC (which was delayed at the last minute due to two issues, one of which was javadoc related, and the other hotspot.
