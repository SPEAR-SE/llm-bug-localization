@JsonProperty(access = Access.READ_ONLY) - unexpected behaviour

Hey,

I was hoping to make use of @JsonProperty(access = Access.READ_ONLY), but failed.

Assume this class:

public class TestPojo
{
    private String firstName;

    private String lastName;

    @JsonProperty(access = Access.READ_ONLY)
    public String getFullName()
    {
        return firstName + " " + lastName;
    }

    public String getFirstName()
    {
        return firstName;
    }

    public void setFirstName(String firstName)
    {
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }

    public String getLastName()
    {
        return lastName;
    }

    public void setLastName(String lastName)
    {
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
}
I couldn't find a way to stop the deserializer from attempting to deserialize the field "fullName".
The only thing that helps is to create a setter and annotate it with @JsonIgnore. However, that setter does not make sense and I don't want to have it. Is this a bug in behaviour or am I missing something? Thanks
