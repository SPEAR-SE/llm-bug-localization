Some providers create JSON date stamps in ISO-8601 formats that cannot be parsed by the jackson-databind library. Here is a sampling of some valid formats that do not parse correctly:
2014-10-03T18:00:00.6-05:00
2014-10-03T18:00:00.61-05:00
1997-07-16T19:20+01:00
1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00
The last two actually come from the ISO-8601 notes on http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime.



Thank you for pointing out this gap!
ISO-8601 definition is big enough that I can't say this would get us to "all compliant variants", but definitely sounds like a reasonable improvement.
One thing I need to verify is just whether some of these might already be covered by one recent patch.



Ok. So, after verifying, this fix IS included in 2.4.3, as originally planned.
