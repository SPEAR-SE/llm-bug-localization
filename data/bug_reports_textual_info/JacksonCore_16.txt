Having 2 parsers concatenated with JsonParserSequence.createFlattened(parser1, parser2).
If the second parser is on a token that is not null and should not be skipped, the JsonParserSequence will still skip it. JsonParserSequence's nextToken() calls nextToken() on the new delegate which may cause that we miss a token.
For more details : forum question
I'll open a PR for this.
Thanks.



Implemented, added simple test; would be great if you could verify that it works for you before 2.8.0 is released.



Hmmh. Actually, trying to change the behavior breaks a few tests in jackson-databind.
Not sure how safe the change is for usage; or whether it actually is even the right thing to do.
I will have to thing about this, and potentially just revert the change unless I can think of reasonable heuristic. Or perhaps just add different constructor for alternate behavior, defaulting to old behavior with existing construction.



The constructor and createFlattened() with the boolean in argument sound good to me. I ran the tests you wrote for this and they pass for me so I guess it must be ok. Btw I had opened #297 for this so I guess you can close it...
Thanks.



New functionality is now in 2.8.0 -- thank you for working through this, let me know if I mangled something.
