With the following HTML:
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; " />
</head>

jsoup fails to parse the page with a IllegalCharsetNameException. I see that http-equiv="Content-Type" has an invalid content-type but it would be possible to still parse it correctly by using the html5  , i.e. jsoup could be more robust on this one.
other domains which are not working but could be:
9kuhkep.net
www.a-bright.org
I use this code to parse the sites:
Jsoup.connect(url).execute()
