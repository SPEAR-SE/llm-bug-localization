What do you see instead?</b>\nI expected a string literal with &quot;\\0&quot; (or something like that)\r\nand instead get a string literal with three null character values.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\ncompiler-20110119.zip on windows 7 x64\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\n\r\nThis is causing an issue with IE9 and jQuery.getScript.
