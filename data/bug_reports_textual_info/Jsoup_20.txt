Hello, Jonathan
I love Jsoup, and handling many html files.
But today, I'm under the  problem.
When parse with Jsoup, some html file's head element will be empty.
Sample html is here -> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/972460/test.html
Please help me.



I'd vote to up the priority of this bug. I've check out the latest version from the repository, it's still not resolved.



Thanks for pointing this out! This issue is fixed now. Please let me know if you see it in other cases.



Hi Jonathan,
We've been using Jsoup in production and loving it as well (good clean API and proper documentation),
Ran into the same problem in this page:
http://www.visualbee.com/lp/visualbee-design-your-powerpoint-presentation.html
same issue of an empty header and this fix didn't help us , as far as i can tell dropping the if switch around the fix (line #94) will do the job for us
Would appreciate handling this
Thanks
