While this may be a contrived example, Jsoup.parse("<!DOCTYPE>") throws an exception, this was unexpected. Possibly related, a proper document with <!DOCTYPE> (no name) is generating corrupt html e.g. "<!DOCTYPE <html> ..." (missing right angle bracket on DOCTYPE.)
Spec says "When a DOCTYPE token is created, its name, public identifier, and system identifier must be marked as missing (which is a distinct state from the empty string), [...]"



DOCTYPE handling has some issues. Jsoup.parse("") is NPE at org.jsoup.parser.TokeniserState # BeforeDoctypeName (t.doctypePending.name.append(replacementChar))



The <!DOCTYPE <html> is because the parser is really expecting a doctype name, and thinks that name is <html
(Where did you come across a doctype without a name? Seems odd use of the tag.)



Thanks for pointing this out!
