PosixParser doesn't stop the bursting process of a token if stopAtNonOption is enabled and a non option character is encountered.
For example if the options a and b are defined, with stopAtNonOption=true the following command line:

-azb

is turned into:

-a zb -b

the right output should be:

-a zb
