Hi
If I have:
final String debugOpt = "debug";
	Option debug = OptionBuilder
	    .withArgName(debugOpt)
	    .withDescription("turn on debugging")
	    .withLongOpt(debugOpt)
	    .create('d');
and then later I do:
String dbg = commandLine.getOptionValue(debugOpt);
then dbg will be null. Instead, I have to use getOptionValue('d'). This seems
contrary to the docs (see bottom of
http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/cli/usage.html), which implies that I should
be able to query the commandLine object using a full string, rather than just
the string's first character.
Can I suggest that the API of OptionBuilder be made clearer so that it is
obvious that you can have long and short option names---perhaps make the
create() method take no arguments (thus forcing long and short arg names to be
set explicitly). (Also, there seems to be some confusion between the terms
'argument' and 'option' in the API, but perhaps that is just me).
Also, I would hop to be able to query commandLine by either a single char or an
entire string, as suggested by the docs.
Thanks,
Chris
