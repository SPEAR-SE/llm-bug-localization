Regression updating from 2.3.3 to 2.4.0: null won't deserialize in String[]

Steps to reproduce

Clone the repository at https://github.com/huxi/sulky
Execute the contained ./gradlew or gradlew.bat
Clone the repository at https://github.com/huxi/lilith/
Change jackson-version in the project.ext.versions map of dependencyDefinitions.gradle from '2.3.3' to '2.4.0'.
Execute the contained ./gradlew or gradlew.bat
There will be six test-failures with 2.4.0 that won't happen with 2.3.3.

There are actually only 2 test-methods that fail 3 times each.

Those methods reside at full() and nullArgument().

I first suspected that AfterburnerModule might be the culprit but removing it from LoggingJsonDecoder/LoggingJsonEncoder didn't fix the problem.

Sorry for not narrowing down the problem further. I'll give this another look tomorrow but you may already be able to find the issue in the meantime.

The interesting thing is that several other test cases are working as intended...
