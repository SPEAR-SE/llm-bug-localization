Hi,
For example this is target URL: http://www.elacontecer.com.uy/rss/hoy.xml, its charset is ISO-8859-1.
I use Jsoup like this:
final Document doc = Jsoup.connect("http://...").parser(Parser.xmlParser()).get();
System.out.println("charset=" + doc.charset());
The result is: java.nio.charset.CharsetICU[UTF-8]
Would you please check to see if it's a bug?
Thanks,



There's no charset defined in the HTTP header, so jsoup falls back its default of UTF8.



@jhy Thank you.
May I ask if it's named XML parser, it should handle XML charset?



Oh, I'm sorry, I missed that it has a <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> start. Yeah we should add support for that.

Thanks, that's great  :-)
And thank you again for a great library.
Have a nice day.
