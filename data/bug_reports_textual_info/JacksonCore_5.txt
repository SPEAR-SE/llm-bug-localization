Json-Patch project leader has noted me that there is a bug on JsonPointer implementation and I have decided to investigate.
Basically if you do something like JsonPointer.compile("/1e0"); it throws a NumberFormatExpcetion which is not true. This is because this piece of code:
private final static int _parseInt(String str)
    {
        final int len = str.length();
        if (len == 0) {
            return -1;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
            char c = str.charAt(i++);
            if (c > '9' || c < '0') {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        // for now, we'll assume 32-bit indexes are fine
        return NumberInput.parseInt(str);
    }
When they found a number it interprets the segment as integer but in reality it should be the whole expression. For this reason I think that the condition should be changed to the inverse condition  (if it doesn't found any char then it is a number.
If you want I can send you a PR as well.

Heh. Have a look at that code again -- there is a bug, but not what you think.
I'll fix this.
