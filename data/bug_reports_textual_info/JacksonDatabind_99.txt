Canonical string for reference type is built incorrectly.
E.g.:
new ReferenceType(new TypeFactory(new LRUMap<Object, JavaType>(0, 10000)).constructType(Object.class), new PlaceholderForType(0)).toCanonical()
yields:
java.lang.Object<$1
while the expected value is:
java.lang.Object<$1>



Thank you for reporting this and pointing out the fix!
I had to manually merge this just for ease of backporting (will be in 2.8/2.9/2.10/3.x), but fix is the suggested one.
