Using 1.10.19.
When using @InjectMocks on some Android TextViews, the mock is injected into the wrong field.
We have two fields, txtGateView & txtNextStep in a class, and our test mocks out txtNextStep, then tried to inject. This field is injected wrong, see screenshot.

From our quick testing, the name txtNextView doesn't matter, that can be changed. But both txtGateView and txtGateLabel messed things up. If we mock out both fields, it works correctly.
Testproject: https://github.com/SimenB/emptyandroid
I don't know if it's because it's Android, but it was easiest for me to create a minimal test from existing code.



@SimenB Maybe txtNextStep TextView Class Mocking the aneunge not work properly?
A bug or would not even be on @Injectmocks features?



I have answered a similar question on Stackoverflow and you can find my investigations at http://stackoverflow.com/a/29954211/2761676



@JeremybellEU Yeah, that seems to be the same thing.
While it explains why it happens, I still consider it to be a bug...



Not a bug, it is just something that was left off.
Thanks @JeremybellEU, I'll look into your PR. Note the merge is gonna happen in 2.x line (which is beta and subject to important changes, both internally and API wise).



After I commented I realised I probably knew how to fix it, so I hope the PR is useful =]. Looking forward to Mockito 2.0.
