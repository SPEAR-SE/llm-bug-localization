Jsoup not retaining &lt in data attributes value if there is <
In the example below &lt; is converted to < in the output after parsing.
Please let me know how to retain it.

Can anyone explain why do we parse html entities within org.jsoup.parser.TokeniserState.AttributeValue_doubleQuoted? Shouldn't all quoted values be left unchanged?
When data-params attribute is parsed, it's internally stored as {"<p>Content</p>"} and it seems there's nothing wrong with it. This case probably invokes toString() which leads to org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute.html(StringBuilder, OutputSettings):
86:             Entities.escape(accum, value, out, true, false, false);
and escapes " back again to &quot; so the final result is: {&quot;<p>Content</p>&quot;}
It happens because when " is found within attribute, it's escaped again to &quot;
                case '"':
                    if (inAttribute)
                        accum.append("&quot;");

but < and > aren't
                case '<':
                    if (!inAttribute)
                        accum.append("&lt;");
                    else
                        accum.append(c);

Maybe someone more experienced can explain this behaviour.

It seems to me that your original value is lost, but you can obtain unescaped value {"<p>Content</p>"} directly from Attribute:
doc.select("a").first().attributes().asList().get(1).getValue().toString();
It's ugly :(

I think the correct fix should be something like below:
I am testing it out to see if it is good in all scenarios. Please let me know your opinion.
case '<':
// xhtml and in attribute
if (inAttribute && escapeMode == EscapeMode.xhtml)
accum.append("<");
// NOT in attribute
else if (!inAttribute)
accum.append("<");
// NON XHTML  and In attribute
else
accum.append(c);
break;



Running org.jsoup.nodes.DocumentTest
Tests run: 11, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 0.107 sec <<< FAILURE!
testOutputEncoding(org.jsoup.nodes.DocumentTest)  Time elapsed: 0.004 sec  <<< FAILURE!
org.junit.ComparisonFailure: expected:<...p title="π">π &amp; [&lt;] &gt; </p>> but was:<...p title="π">π &amp; [<] &gt; </p>>

but after a small correction it seems to pass all the tests:
case '<':
    // xhtml and in attribute
    if (inAttribute && escapeMode == EscapeMode.xhtml)
        accum.append("<");
    // NOT in attribute
    else if (!inAttribute)
        accum.append("&lt;");
    // NON XHTML and In attribute
    else
        accum.append(c);
    break;




It took me a while to understand this -- the allowed characters in an XML attribute are different to HTML
HTML: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#attributes-2
XML: http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-AttValue
