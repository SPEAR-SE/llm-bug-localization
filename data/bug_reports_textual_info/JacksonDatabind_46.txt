(see FasterXML/jackson-modules-base#8 for background)
It looks like generic signature generation is missing one closing > character to produce:
()Ljava/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicReference<Ljava/lang/String;;

instead of expected
()Ljava/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicReference<Ljava/lang/String;>;

that is, closing '>' is missing.
