Given the following XML document: <root id="1234"/>
and the XPath: //root/@id/text().
JXPath returns null instead of "1234".
JXPathContext context = JXPathContext.newContext(doc);
assertEquals(value, context.selectSingleNode("//root/@id/text()"));
The attached JUnit test highlights the problem. It seems that JXPath does not
find the root node if it is accessed with the axis descendant-or-self.
