LeafNode.childNodes() throws UnsupportedOperationException since this commit:
f71712b#diff-605d28890f72a0f43298f842d0a3414f
The javadoc of Node.childNodes() says this:
@return list of children. If no children, returns an empty list.
But in the case of a LeafNode, which has no children, it throws UnsupportedOperationException. This is because childNodes() calls ensureChildNodes(), which throws an exception when called on a LeafNode.
The result is that the calling application needs to guard against this case. But the application should not need to know if the Node it has is a LeafNode or not.
LeafNode.childNodes() should simply return an empty list as it used to do, and as per the javadoc.



Thanks for reporting this issue. Fixed!
