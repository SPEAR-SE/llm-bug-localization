I found that when running Jsoup.clean() on a string that contains the format below, Jsoup throws: IllegalArgumentException: String must not be empty.
The problematic string format:
'<a/*>', (where * is a control char).
i.e. < char followed by a letter (a-z), then any chars, / and any control char (ASCII 0-31) except 0, 9-10, 12-13, any chars, and a > char.



Fixed, thanks!
