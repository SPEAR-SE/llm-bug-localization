(This is happening with 2.5.0. Haven't tried 2.5.1 but I couldn't see any related issue anyway)
Jackson ignores JsonSerialize annotation when there is JsonAnyGetter annotation.
  @JsonSerialize(using = MySerializer.class)
  // or
  @JsonSerialize(converter = MyConverter.class)
  @JsonAnyGetter
  public Map<String, String> getParameters(){
    return parameters;
  }
except
@JsonSerialize(keyUsing = MyKeySerializer.class)
(haven't tried each setting. Only tried keyUsing because I've seen a different issue (#661) with it)
Then it works. But I need the converter, so..
For the time being I will use
  @JsonAnyGetter
  public Map<String, JsonNode> getParameters(){
    return new MyConverter().convert(parameters);
  }
but I'd prefer to stick to annotations.



Thank you for reporting this.
