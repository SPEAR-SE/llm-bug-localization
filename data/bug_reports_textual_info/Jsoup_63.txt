This code snippet returns invalid html with the message: "Self closing flag not acknowledged"
Jsoup.isValid("<p>test<br/>test</p>")
Why breaks could not be self closing?



Because that's the spec. HTML5 doesn't use self-closing tags for tags that can't contain anything, like br, img, etc.
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#self-closing-flag



According to https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#void-elements , <br/> is not disallowed, see section 8.1.2.1, point 6:

Then, if the element is one of the void elements, or if the element is a foreign element, then there may be a single "/" (U+002F) character. This character has no effect on void elements, but on foreign elements it marks the start tag as self-closing.

Since <br> is a void element (https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#void-elements), <br/>should be considered valid.



Thanks, I misread this part of the spec (or was updated after implementing)
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#parsing-main-inbody

A start tag whose tag name is one of: "area", "br", "embed", "img", "keygen", "wbr"
Reconstruct the active formatting elements, if any.
Insert an HTML element for the token. Immediately pop the current node off the stack of open elements.
Acknowledge the token's self-closing flag, if it is set.
Set the frameset-ok flag to "not ok".
