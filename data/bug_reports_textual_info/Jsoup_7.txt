The page I will attach results in a Jsoup tree with two body elements, neither if which is a direct child of the html element.
You will find the page in "git@github.com:bimargulies/Misc.git" under the jsoup-tc directory.



Thanks, this is fixed now.



Document normalisation now more correctly enforces document structure.

ensure only one head and one body element, both under html el
allow html/head/noscript/img for some site's analytic pattern
