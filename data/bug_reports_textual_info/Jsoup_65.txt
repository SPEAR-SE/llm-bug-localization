I've been experimenting with jsoup as a validator for TensorBoard code and I encountered a bug.
If I have code like this:
          <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <template is="dom-if" if="{{smoothingEnabled}}">
              <th>Smoothed</th>
            </template>   
            <th>Value</th>
            <th>Step</th>
            <th>Time</th>
            <th>Relative</th>
          </tr>
I get errors like this:
ERROR: tensorflow/tensorboard/components/vz_line_chart/vz-line-chart.html (offset 1282): Unexpected token [StartTag] when in state [InTable]
ERROR: tensorflow/tensorboard/components/vz_line_chart/vz-line-chart.html (offset 1338): Unexpected token [EndTag] when in state [InTable]
ERROR: tensorflow/tensorboard/components/vz_line_chart/vz-line-chart.html (offset 1338): Unexpected token [EndTag] when in state [InBody]
Please note that those offset numbers point to the <template> tags.
Template tag is legal here because https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/tabular-data.html#the-tr-element says content model for tr is "Zero or more td, th, and script-supporting elements" and template is a script supporting element.



Thanks for pointing it out. I'll need to refactor the InsertionModes in the tree builder as the <template> object introduces an insertion mode stack.
Will probably take a pass at the implementation without having the children of template become associated with another Document/DocumentFragment like described (in the whatwg spec that we follow, not w3c) because without a scripting implementation I think it's just complexity that won't help users.



Right now I'm investigating whether or not jsoup will be a good library for validating all the Polymer code maintained by hundreds of Googlers. Polymer code uses <template> very heavily. I want Googlers to be able to benefit from the amazing work you've done. What would you advise?



Thanks, merged #901
