Enter the following into the online compiler\r\n\r\n  var foo = function bar(){\r\n    var bar;\r\n    alert(bar)\r\n  };\r\n\r\n 2.  Compile using simple optimization\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output?

            "content": "Thanks for the report.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem with how the compiler currently models the scope, which is overly simplistic.  The variable \"bar\" should shadow the function name but does not.\r\n\r\nWe can work around this by tweaking the local name normalization like we do for catch declarations or by removing the name from function expression (which is inaccessible).  The proper fix will likely wait until ES6 support with its lexically scoped declarations (let, const, function).",
