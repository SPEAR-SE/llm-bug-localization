Create a JavaScript file with the followiing:\r\n/** @define {string} */\r\nvar CONSTANT = &quot;some very long string name that I want to wrap &quot; +\r\n               &quot;and so break using a + since I don't want to &quot; +\r\n               &quot;introduce a newline into the string.&quot;\r\n2.  Run closure-compiler on the .js file.\r\n3.  See it generate an error on the '+'.\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nIt should work, since the line is assigning a constant value to the var.\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\nRemoving the '+' and making the string all one line does work correctly.\r\n",
