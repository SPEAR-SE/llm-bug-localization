XYSeries.addOrUpdate() should add if duplicates are allowed

I've found a bug in jfreechart-1.0.9 code for org.jfree.data.xy.XYSeries. There was a change some time ago which introduced the notion of allowing duplicate X values in XYSeries data. The method addOrUpdate(Number x, Number y) was never modified to support this, and therefore duplicate data were overwriting existing data. This is the fix I've made, but I don't know how to submit a patch...

Hi,
I think there is still something wrong with this.
If you have autosort true and allowduplicates true as well, it can happen that the value already exists and it is the first in the list, in which case the index returned would be zero. And we end up trying to add a new value at index -1, which makes it blow up with:
java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: -1, Size: 13
at java.util.ArrayList.add(ArrayList.java:367)
at org.jfree.data.xy.XYSeries.addOrUpdate(XYSeries.java:571)
Thanks,
Teodor
