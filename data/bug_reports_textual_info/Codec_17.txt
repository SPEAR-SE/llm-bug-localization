Method calls such as StringUtils.newStringIso8859_1(null) should return null, not NPE.
It looks like this capability was lost with the fix for CODEC-136, i.e.
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1306366&view=rev
Several methods were changed from

return StringUtils.newString(bytes, CharEncoding.xxx);
to
return new String(bytes, Charsets.xxx);


The new code should have been:

return newString(bytes, Charsets.xxx);


The newString method handles null input.
There were no tests for null input so the change in behaviour was missed.
