Hi, thanks for the PR
I will take a look at it soon. And probably merge it. In the mean time, git history is fine except the merge commit, can you get rid of it ?
Otherwise I'll have to cherry-pick relevant commits.



I will try to do rebase and then do 'force' push. Hope it will work.
Take a look...
Hm, I see merge conflicts, probably due your activity today :)



Commit looks good, but indeed there's some conflict to narrow down. I'll take a look later, thanks for the rebase ;)



now it should work...



Thanks ;)
