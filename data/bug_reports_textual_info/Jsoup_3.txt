When calling append to add a table row the resulting tr gets wrapped in a table even though I appended to an existing table.



Thanks for the report.
This example has effectively the same root cause as http://groups.google.com/group/jsoup/browse_thread/thread/81e7a1e326108715?hl=en_US#
The valid ancestor check needs a bit of a refactor to fix.



Improved implicit close tag heuristic detection when parsing malformed HTML.
Fixes an issue where appending / prepending rows to a table (or  to similar implicit
element structures) would create a redundant wrapping elements.
