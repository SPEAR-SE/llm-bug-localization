In particular case a HTTP-Webpage responses with a invalid HTTP-Charset field (delivered UFT8 instead of UTF8).
This leads to an UnsupportedCharsetException in org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil at around Line 93(?) where :
  Validate.notEmpty(charsetName, "Must set charset arg to character set of file to parse. Set to null to attempt to detect from HTML");
  docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();
I fixed it by wrapping a try catch statement around these two lines such that:
try{
  Validate.notEmpty(charsetName, "Must set charset arg to character set of file to parse. Set to null to attempt to detect from HTML");
  docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();
} catch(UnsupportedCharsetException e){
  return parseByteData(byteData,(String)null,baseUri,parser);
}
It now falls back to the none charset argument assigned clause, and tries to detect the character set via HTML.



Thanks!



how to use the new library with this modification in a java project ??
It seems the downloads in http://jsoup.org/download has not been updated
thanks



you can checkout the repository, and use it instead of using the provided zip archive. The current head should contain a modified version.



yes, i downloaded the master copy from github but i dont know how to get it working.
i imported it as a library but it gives error that file not found.



then learn how to use eclipse or netbeans or whatever ... you can not import it as a project ... link source or create a new project using the checkout as source may helps you ...



will this also solve this issue : Charset used is : NONE
Exception in thread "main" java.nio.charset.UnsupportedCharsetException: NONE
at java.nio.charset.Charset.forName(Charset.java:505)
at org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil.parseByteData(DataUtil.java:92)
at org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection$Response.parse(HttpConnection.java:469)
at org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.get(HttpConnection.java:147)
at htmltoplaintext1.HtmlToPlainText1.main(HtmlToPlainText1.java:30)



As far as I can see the current head does not contain my modification.
I had the same problem, at this line, that's why I provided a patch for this.
Obviously the maintainer/developer/whatever does not include it.
If you have the source code you can simply go to line 92 and replace this line with the lines I provided.
This should do the trick for all invalid character sets only valid will apply...



i modified the source code which you have provided but when i use the library, it always uses the .class file. How do i generate the class file for this?
I tried generating the class file by compiling but it gives errors.
