(background, see: dropwizard/dropwizard#1449)
Looks like sub-type resolution may be broken for one particular case: that of using defaultImpl. If so, appears like properties from super-types are not properly resolved; guessing this could be follow-up item for #1083 (even sooner than I thought...).



While this could be related to #1128 that issue has now been resolved and there's no reproduction, so closing for now.



Second try: guessing this is related to handling of StdSubtypeResolver.
