The WHATWG spec for HTML syntax indicates that if there is a newline directly after an opening <pre> or <textarea>, it should be removed.
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#element-restrictions
jsoup currently does not do this:
Jsoup.parse("<pre>\nabc  def</pre>").select("pre").get(0).childNodes().get(0).text();
// Outputs  " abc def"
// Expected "abc def"

Arguably, jsoup is also wrong for the value of getWholeText(), although I guess this depends on one's interpretation of what getWholeText() is supposed to do. I am hoping that it intends to correspond to the value of Node.nodeValue, in which case:
Jsoup.parse("<pre>\nabc  def</pre>").select("pre").get(0).childNodes().get(0).getWholeText();
// Outputs  "\nabc  def"
// Expected "abc  def" 

Jsoup.parse("<pre>\n\nabc  def</pre>").select("pre").get(0).childNodes().get(0).getWholeText();
// Outputs  "\n\nabc  def"
// Expected "\nabc  def"




Thanks, done.



The spec listed above also says that the first newline is not optional if the contents itself starts with a new line:

The otherwise optional newline must be included if the element's contents themselves start with a newline (because otherwise the leading newline in the contents would be treated like the optional newline, and ignored)."

Currently, several roundtrips through jsoup decoding/encoding will eliminate all leading newlines from <pre> which is probably not the correct behavior.
