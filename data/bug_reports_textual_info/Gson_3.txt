ConcurrentNavigableMap was introduced in JDK 1.6.
@swankjesse @JakeWharton @joel-leitch  Shall we abandon support for JDK 1.5?



I'm in favor. JVM users on Java 5 aren't likely going to be updating their Gson instances at any frequent pace. The stronger realization of this change is that it eliminates Android 2.2 and older. This accounts for 0.2% of the 1.some billion devices that talk to Google Play in the last 2 weeks. As far as I know, Google has stopped officially supporting it with their apps, and this was well behind others who have long since moved on from this far outdated platform.



Yeah, those users can continue to use earlier releases.



Ok. Agreed. Let's switch to Java 6 as the minimum version once we introduce support for ConcurrentNavigableMap and other Java 6 standard classes.
