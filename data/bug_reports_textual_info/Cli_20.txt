PosixParser keeps processing tokens after a non unrecognized long option when stopAtNonOption is enabled. The tokens after the unrecognized long option are burst, split around '=', etc.. instead of being kept as is.
For example, with the options 'a' and 'b' defined, 'b' having an argument, the following command line:

--zop -abfoo

is interpreted as:

--zop -a -b foo

but the last token should remain unchanged.
