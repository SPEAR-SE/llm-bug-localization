Have a look at the following document:
<a:doc xmlns:a="ns">
  <a:elem />
  <b:elem xmlns:b="ns" />
</a:doc>
We have two elements 'elem' in the same namespace 'ns'.
They have a different prefix, however.
When we use JXPathContext.iteratePointers() to iterate over them, the first element is returned two times. The second element is not returned.
This is because
in class org.apache.commons.jxpath.ri.model.dom.DOMNodePointer
in method getRelativePositionByName() (line 546)
we have:
if (nm.equals(node.getNodeName()))
In the example, we have
nm  == "a:elem" and node == "b:elem"
Thus, equals() returns false. But since 'a' and 'b' are just different prefixes for the same namespace URI, we should have 'true'.
I attached a testcase which reproduces the bug.
