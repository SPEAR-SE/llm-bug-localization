Based on these issues:

FasterXML/jackson-annotations#96
I implemented @JsonProperty for my enum constants and they show up nicely when they are property values. But I also have an EnumMap which uses the enum, and it's generated JSON uses the original enum names for the keys and not the JsonProperty values.
Using 2.8.1 (in spring boot 4.3.2)
Thanks!



Thank you for reporting this.



Ok, looks like use of @JsonValue works at least. Next checking @JsonProperty part.



I can reproduce this, and can see the problem. Fix will take a while, need to add Enum-specific key serializer. Not particularly difficult to do but... some work.
