The line
System.out.println(Jsoup.clean("<h1>Ãœberschrift</h1>", Whitelist.none()));

should print
&Uuml;berschrift

but prints
&uuml;berschrift

This used to work correctly in v0.3.1, but fails in v1.2.3.
While baseArray in Entities.java distinguishes between lowercase and uppercase umlauts, the above call yields the wrong result.



Thanks for reporting this -- I'll fix it for the next release.



Fixed support for case-sensitive HTML escape entities.
