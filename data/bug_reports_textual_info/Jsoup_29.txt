We assume that we just need 1 line title string from below uri.
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/lookandfeel/nimbus.html
we can see title like as below by viewing page source code in that page (of course, It is real situation.)
<title>Nimbus Look and Feel (The Java™ Tutorials >        
            Creating a GUI With JFC/Swing > Modifying the Look and Feel)
</title>

maybe some another page has multiline title, but browser will shows ordinarily.
in the other words, Browser shows one line title without CR/LF and redundant space character
whether string has newline character or many redundant space or tab, or not.
But,
When we execute Jsoup.connect(uri).get().title(); after we assign
"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/lookandfeel/nimbus.html" into uri variable as String,
it gives two lines like below,
"Nimbus Look and Feel (The Java™ Tutorials >         "
"            Creating a GUI With JFC/Swing > Modifying the Look and Feel)"
"Nimbus Look and Feel (The Java™ Tutorials > Creating a GUI With JFC/Swing > Modifying the Look and Feel)"
is better, I think.
Humm ... do you have another idea?
