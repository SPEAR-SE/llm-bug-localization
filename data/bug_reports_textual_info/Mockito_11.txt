Hi Szczepan,
Thanks for the reply, I'll simplify the methods now - do I open a new pull request, or somehow edit this one?  Sorry - I'm new to GitHub and Git!
I haven't used a custom VerificationMode in anger yet, I'm actually writing a tutorial on Mockito and wanted to show one as an example.  The one I wrote would verify that an invocation was the first invocation on a Mock, and I had a lot of hair pulling when the .equals() of my chunk and all invocations didn't evaluate to true, even though it was the same object!
Regards,
Hugh



VerificationMode is not a public API. Devs are welcome to use it and tell us about the use cases :)
It does have strict backwards-compatibility constraints. Other words, we can change it without notice. However, we do plan to publicize this API. If only there were more days in a week :)
Update this PR or create a new one. Whatever is simpler for you.
Thanks again!



Not sure why this failed to build - the tests are passing locally.
Thanks for the info about VerificationMode - I'll stick a health warning in the tutorial for that section!



The build failed due to a flaky test, don't worry about it.



Updated again, I was a bit trigger happy with the commit! Hopefully that's it! :)



Oh, right, I'm merging it, let's see if continuous deployment actually works... :)
