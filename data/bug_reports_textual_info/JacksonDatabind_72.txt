Minimal repro:
public class Something {
    public InnerSomething a;

    @JsonCreator
    public Something(@JsonProperty("a") InnerSomething a) {}

    class InnerSomething {
        @JsonCreator
        public InnerSomething() {}
    }

}
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        String ser = mapper.writeValueAsString(new Something(null));
        mapper.readValue(ser, Something.class);
Fails like this:
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -1

	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.impl.PropertyValueBuffer.assignParameter(PropertyValueBuffer.java:210)
	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.BeanDeserializer._deserializeUsingPropertyBased(BeanDeserializer.java:380)

Validation is missing for this impossible constructor. Works as expected when InnerSomething is static.



Definitely feels like this is related to #1502 too, errors seem to vary slightly based on minor differences.



Interesting: fails on 2.7, 2.8 branches, but on master.



And the reason for failure was that of not delegating various methods from InnerClassProperty to underlying CreatorProperty; something that was actually fixed for master (by creating a "delegating" base class for such properties).
I suspect this will resolve #1502 and/or #1503 but will check them separately.



One additional note: actual test case will not actually pass due to complications of trying to pass inner class as creator parameter (it would, however, work as "regular" property). This may or may not be fixable, but at least exception message is more descriptive.
