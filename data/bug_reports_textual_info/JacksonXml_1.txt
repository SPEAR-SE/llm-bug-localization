Looks like there is a problem, wherein nested structures like say:

Definition POJO, with records, unwrapped List with Record
Record POJO having property fields, another unwrapped list of Field POJOs

and case where inner List happens to be empty/missing, cause incorrectly "split" parts of outermost Lists (here for property records).
I will come up with a full reproduction later on, but observed this in the wild, and I think it occurs with latest 2.7.0-rc code, as well as 2.6.4-1, so is not just something that has been fixed with a later version.
