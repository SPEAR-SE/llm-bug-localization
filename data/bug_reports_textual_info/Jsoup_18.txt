I think this is a bug.
Version: jsoup-1.6.0.jar
Source:
---------BEGIN
<img alt=""
         src="/imagelibraries/homepagebanners/british_10k_2010.jpg" />

---------END
Steps to reproduce: element.outerHtml() ->
Expected result: two attributes alt and src
Observed result output
----------BEGIN
<img alt="" ="" src="/imagelibraries/homepagebanners/british_10k_2010.jpg" />
----------END



Thanks for pointing this out! Newlines were correctly being ignored in tags, but carriage returns were not being normalised correctly.



Great work - thanks a lot! Great library btw.
