First of all, thank you for reporting this.
But would it be possible to write a test that shows how this actually works? It would be great to have a regression test, to guard against this happening in future.



The gist I posted was an example that I can make into a test but like I said, I wasn't sure where the test should go. I can't seem to find any general parsing tests.



@aeyerstaylor ah sorry, I skimmed over issue text too fast. That should be enough, I can work with it.
There are a few tests similar to this. I'll also need to patch this in 2.9 branch (then merge forward) so I might as well make these, cover both byte- and char-backed parsers.



@aeyerstaylor I ended up merging this manually -- thank you very much for submitting the report, fix! And if you find other likely bugs via LGTM (I noticed there were couple of other warnings), looking forward to more reports!
