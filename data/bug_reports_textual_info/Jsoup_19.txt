Ok, so in mail type HTML the following is common

The item after CID: can be almost anything (US-ASCII I think) and of any length. It corresponds to an image linked elsewhere in MIME say like this
--mimebounday
Content-ID:
Content-Type: image/jpeg.....
(snip)
So, to mark a long story somewhat shorter, I use Jsoup's sanitizer extensively. However, I need these CID references to be preserved post sanitization. addProtocols does not work because the items are not valid URLs. As a result
the above becomes . Which for my purposes is not good :)



see http://xml.resource.org/public/rfc/html/rfc2392.html
for description of the cid protocol schema, which is an internet standard. I suspect mailto could also not be unsanitized, but haven't tried it.



Related to this the data uri is also sanitized and cannot be whitelisted.



So I've worked around this in a lame fashion

use jsoup to parse
find all cid: refs in img tags
replace them with http://contentid.com/
sanitize
find all  http://contentid.com/ refs
replace with data uris

but the issue with mailto, cid, and data really should be somehow addressable. I grant you they are abusable tags and ones that should not be whitelisted lightly



Thanks for suggesting this!
