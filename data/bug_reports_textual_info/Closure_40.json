What do you see instead?</b>\nThe compiler will crash. The last var check throws an illegal state exception because it knows something is wrong.\r\n\r\nThe crash is caused by smartNameRemoval. It has special logic for counting references in class-defining function calls (like goog.inherits), and it isn't properly creating a reference to PageSelectionModel.",
