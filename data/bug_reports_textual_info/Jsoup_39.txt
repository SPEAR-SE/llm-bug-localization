If you load the following URL:
http://jornutzon.sydneyoperahouse.com/home.htm

into:
http://try.jsoup.org/

then it will move the content from the "head" section into the "body" section. The URL
being parsed validates using the W3C validator:
http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fjornutzon.sydneyoperahouse.com%2Fhome.htm&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&ss=1&group=0&user-agent=W3C_Validator%2F1.3+http%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fservices
We are using JSoup 1.7.2



That took me a while to figure out. There's a BOM at the start of the doc which jsoup isn't handling correctly. Grr arg! It's 65279



Specifically, the character is not recognized as a BOM but as a regular character, to it moves the parser state into body mode
