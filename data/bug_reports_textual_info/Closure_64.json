Create a JS file called &quot;alert.js&quot; with the contents &quot;alert(getNum());&quot;\r\n3.  Compile the two files with the following command:\r\n\r\njava -jar compiler.jar --language_in=ECMASCRIPT5_STRICT --compilation_level=ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS --warning_level=VERBOSE --js get_num.js --js alert.js\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\n\r\nI would expect the output to be:\r\n\r\n'use strict';alert(5);\r\n\r\nor, if the compiler wants to be really clever, just &quot;alert(5)&quot; since this is already ES5 Strict compliant.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nHead on Mac OS X\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/closure-compiler-discuss/TOLXpePju5Q",
