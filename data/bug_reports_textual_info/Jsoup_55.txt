Hello,
I don't know if it is a bug or not, but when I'm parsing:
<img /onerror="a()"/>
The result of the parsers is:
<img nerror="a()"/>
Is it OK? can I change the parser behavior for those types of tags?



It sounds like there's a bug around the Before Attribute Name State when it hits the slash and moves into and then back out of Self Closing State. The / should be consumed but the o should remain. If you want to update the parser that would be great! Should work as specced in https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#before-attribute-name-state



What do You think about this fix: #747



I've changed the pull request. here is the new one: #748



Thanks! Merged
