Specifically when I call:
Document doc = Jsoup.parse(xhtml, "", Parser.xmlParser());

on a xhtml document that has the following doctype:
<!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "exampledtdfile.dtd">

I end up with the following result in the document (SYSTEM is now missing):
<!DOCTYPE html "exampledtdfile.dtd"> 

But this works fine on a document with:
 <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> 

Since SYSTEM is a proper way of declaring a DTD, I believe this is an issue with Jsoup.



@gzli92 ,
This thing is also happening to me, and not only has to do with the SYSTEM identifier.
Having a file header like:


Parsing my document twice:

Jsoup.parse(new FileInputStream(xmlFile), FILE_ENCODING, xmlFile.getPath(), Parser.xmlParser());

Will generate this in the first iteration (parse):


And then generate this in the second iteration (parse):


And I am using the latest version so far (1.8.3)



@jhy can you make a statement to this issue, please.



Thanks!
