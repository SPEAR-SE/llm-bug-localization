"Based on the analysis of the covered methods by the important tests, the additional suspicious methods that might be causing the issue are:\n1. `org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64.encodeBase64Chunked(Base64.java)`\n2. `org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64.encodeBase64(Base64.java)`\n\nNow, I will rank the top 5 suspicious methods based on the analysis:\n```json\n{\n    \"method_signatures\": [\n        \"org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64.encode(Base64.java:502)\",\n        \"org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64InputStream.read(Base64InputStream.java:157)\",\n        \"org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64InputStream.read(Base64InputStream.java:109)\",\n        \"org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64.encodeBase64Chunked(Base64.java)\",\n        \"org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64.encodeBase64(Base64.java)\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning behind these choices is that these methods are directly related to the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` issue reported in the bug report and stack trace. Further analysis of these methods may help in identifying the root cause of the problem."
