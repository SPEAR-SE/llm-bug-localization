"Based on the analysis of the bug report, stack trace, and the methods covered by important tests, the following methods are identified as suspicious and may need further analysis to find the fault:\n\n1. org.mockito.internal.configuration.GlobalConfiguration.getIt\n2. org.mockito.internal.configuration.GlobalConfiguration.getDefaultAnswer\n3. org.mockito.internal.progress.ThreadSafeMockingProgress.validateState\n4. org.mockito.internal.progress.ThreadSafeMockingProgress.reset\n5. org.mockito.internal.progress.ThreadSafeMockingProgress.resetOngoingStubbing\n\nThese methods are related to the configuration and progress tracking of Mockito, which aligns with the reported issue of JUnit dependency causing errors. Further investigation into these methods may help in identifying the root cause of the problem.\n\n```json\n{\n        \"method_signatures\": [\n            \"org.mockito.internal.configuration.GlobalConfiguration.getIt\",\n            \"org.mockito.internal.configuration.GlobalConfiguration.getDefaultAnswer\",\n            \"org.mockito.internal.progress.ThreadSafeMockingProgress.validateState\",\n            \"org.mockito.internal.progress.ThreadSafeMockingProgress.reset\",\n            \"org.mockito.internal.progress.ThreadSafeMockingProgress.resetOngoingStubbing\"\n        ]\n}\n```"
